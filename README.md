# Automatic-ReadMe-Generator


## Description
Seventh bootcamp challenge, using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research
(including Youtube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make an automatic ReadMe generator. It must run in the command line,
accept user input, and displays it within the document. When you click on the links within the table of contents, you are
then taken to the corresponding section of the ReadMe. When a license is selected, it displays a badge and all relevant license
information. When you enter your GitHub URL and email, you can find them under a questions section.
